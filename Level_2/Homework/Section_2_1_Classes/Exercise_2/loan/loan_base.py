# Type: Homework
# Level: 2
# Section: 2.1: Classes
# Exercise: 2
# Description: This contains the Loan classes and its methods
#   Create a basic loan class exactly as demonstrated in the lecture (including the setter/getter property
#   methods). Then, extend it with methods that return the following (refer to the slides for any
#   necessary formulas):
#       a. The monthly payment amount of the loan (monthlyPayment). Even though
#           monthlyPayment is likely to be equal for all months, you should still define this with a
#           dummy ‘period’ parameter, since it’s possible some loan types will have a monthly payment
#           dependent on the period.
#       b. The total payments over the entire loan (totalPayments). This is principal plus interest.
#       c. The total interest over the entire loan (totalInterest).

    # Also included in this function is ability to set the arguments to 0 if they don't already exists
    def __init__(self, notional, rate, term):
