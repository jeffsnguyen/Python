# Type: Homework
# Level: 2
# Section: 2.2: Intermediate Classes
# Exercise: 3
# Description: This contains test for MortgageMixin class methods.
#   Create a MortgageMixin class which will contain mortgage-specific methods. In particular, weâ€™d like
#       to implement the concept of Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI). For those unaware, PMI is an extra
#       monthly payment that one must make to compensate for the added risk of having a Loan-to-Value
#       (LTV) ratio of less than 80% (in other words, the loan covers >= 80% of the value of the asset).
#   To this end, implement a function called PMI that returns 0.0075% of the loan face value, but only if
#       the LTV is < 80%. For now, assume that the initial loan amount is for 100% of the asset value.
#   Additionally, override the base class monthlyPayment and principalDue functions to account for
#       PMI (Hint: use super to avoid duplicating the formulas, and note that the other methods
#       (interestDue, balance, etc.) should not require any changes).
