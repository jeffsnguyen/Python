# Section: 2.2: Intermediate Classes
# Exercise: 5
# Description: This contains Loan class methods
#   Now that we have our Loan and Asset classes, let’s incorporate the asset into the loan. As a loan is
#       ‘on an’ asset, which is similar to ‘has a’, we use composition instead of derivation. To this end:
#
#   a. Add an asset parameter to the base loan __init__ function, which saves it down into an
#       object-level attribute. The one caveat here is that we must to ensure that the asset
#       parameter indeed contains an Asset object (or any of its derived classes). If it’s not an Asset
#       type, you should print an error message to the user, and leave the function.
#   b. Modify MortgageMixin to initialize with a home parameter. In this case, we need to ensure
#       that the value of home is indeed a primary home, vacation home, or any other derived
#       HouseBase type. Modify the PMI function to calculate LTV based on the asset initial value
#       (instead of the loan’s face value).
#   c. Do the same for the AutoLoan class.
#   d. Create a method called recoveryValue in the Loan base class. This method should return the
#       current asset value for the given period, times a recovery multiplier of 0.6.
#   e. Create a method called equity in the Loan base class. This should return the available equity
#       (the asset value less the loan balance).
#   f. In main, instantiate different Loan types with different assets and test the new functionality.
#
#   Note that the ‘recovery value’ of an asset, in terms of a loan, is the amount of money the lender
#       can recover if the borrower defaults (forecloses). The lender will usually auction off the
#       property. The ‘multiplier’ is necessary, as the lender is not likely to receive full market value of
#       the property in an auction. The above is an overly simplistic model, as the recovery rates vary
#       across asset classes and markets (the subject of a different course).
