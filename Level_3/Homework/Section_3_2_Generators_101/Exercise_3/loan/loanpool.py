# Type: Homework
# Level: 2
# Section: 3.2: Generators
# Exercise: 3
# Description: This contains LoanPool class methods
#   Modify your LoanPool class to be an iterable. To do this, you will need to define an __iter__ method
#       within the class; this method should be a generator, that returns one Loan at a time. Effectively, the
#       result will be that you should be able to loop over a LoanPool objectâ€™s individual Loan objects. For
#       example, the following should now work:
#           for loan in loanPool:
#               print(loan.notional)


# Importing packages
from loan.loan_base import Loan


# LoanPool Class
class LoanPool(object):
    def __init__(self, loans=None):
        self._loans = loans
        self._loan = [loan for loan in self._loans]
        self._notional = [loan.notional for loan in self._loans]
        self._rate = [loan.rate for loan in self._loans]
        self._term = [loan.term for loan in self._loans]
        self._asset = [loan.asset for loan in self._loans] # Added asset parameter to update with changes

    # Make the class iterable
    # Generator returning one Loan at a time.
    def __iter__(self, loans=None):
        for loan in self._loans:
            yield loan
