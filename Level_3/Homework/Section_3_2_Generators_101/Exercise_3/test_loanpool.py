# Exercise: 3
# Description: Contains the tests to modified LoanPool class
#   Modify your LoanPool class to be an iterable. To do this, you will need to define an __iter__ method
#       within the class; this method should be a generator, that returns one Loan at a time. Effectively, the
#       result will be that you should be able to loop over a LoanPool objectâ€™s individual Loan objects. For
#       example, the following should now work:
#           for loan in loanPool:
#               print(loan.notional)
