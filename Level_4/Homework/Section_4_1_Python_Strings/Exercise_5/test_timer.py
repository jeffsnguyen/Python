# Type: Homework
# Level: 4
# Section: 4.1: Python Strings
# Exercise: 5
# Description: Contains the tests for modified Timer class
#   Convert your Timer classâ€™ print statement to use f-Strings instead of concatenating strings.

    # Scenario:
    #   This block will:
    #       1. Test the modified Timer class to time babyShark file IO in Exercise 3.4.1
    #       2. Test the modified Timer class to time babyShark file IO in Exercise 3.4.1
    #           and its ability to config time display format
    #       3. Test the modified Timer class to time babyShark file IO in Exercise 3.4.1
    #           and its ability to config time display format.  This time using incorrect timer config format.

    # The Context Manager approach is compared to previous method is:
    #       1. Cleaner, does not requires explicitly calling start() and end()
    #       2. Enable on-demand resources allocation
    #       3. Exception handling is easier
