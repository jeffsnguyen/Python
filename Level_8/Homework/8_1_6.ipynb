    "In practice, this is really useful when running Monte Carlo simulations over data that has a known correlation. For example, if we know a set of underlying Stock prices are correlated and\n",
    "we wish to simulate how a portfolio of their Option prices react: We can price each Option using a Monte Carlo simulation individually; however, doing so individually will not give us insight into the portfolio value. Instead, we can create an array of random, correlated Stock prices. There are two ways to do this (you should attempt both), with the following steps:  \n",

    "a. Pick 10 stocks from any stock exchange and get their last 10 closing prices – put these into an ndarray, and calculate the covariance matrix.  \n",
    "b. Use numpy.random’s multivariate_normal to create a correlated array of random numbers, based on the above covariance matrix.  \n",
